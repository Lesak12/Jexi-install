# jexactyl-installer

A totally real script that installs Jexactyl and Wings.

This script is a another version of [Blxvyy's installation script](https://github.com/Blxvyy/Jexactyl-Installation-Script) so it only works on Ubuntu 22.04, might update it to 23.04.

Since this script is copied from another script, both the copyright and license will not be changed. If you are the original guy that made the script and want to take it down, contact me at itzbenoitxd@free.fr

## How to use this script?
Run this commands in a terminal:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lesak12/Install-jexa/main/install.sh && bash install.sh
```
That's it! Now just answer questions as asked and your panel should be installed!

_Star this repository if you totally like the script! ;)_

> If you are having some issues, contact me at `amogus#6200` and I'll teach you how to read docs. Again, you won't get any support from Jexactyl for using an install script.
